# Why a Bridge?

It's funny the number of people with opinions about your brand when you start a new company. It seems like a common theme comes up when we start talking about the Bridge Alliance. 

"You know there is already a non-profit called Bridge in North Texas?"

"That sounds really generic"

"Have you done your research on SEO? You can't own BridgeAlliance.com?"

Yes, there are many different reasons and ways to name a company and I believe in the creative concept process that is rooted in the values and mission of the company.

I believe that branding is defined by what you do, how you do it and why you do something.

The Bridge Alliance is a program that brings together Enterprise, Startups and Academia in the spirit of Innovation. All other execution elements of website, color palette, business cards, SEO need to support this ideal. If the reasons to name a company are because of execution reasons, those quite frankly are not good reasons.

So, here we go on why it's called Bridge Alliance.
